# Fed Clock 

Fed Clock takes an employees clock in time and a clock out time 
and returns the time worked as a decimal format as well
as how far over or under a full day of work they were.

I created Fed Clock because a coworker of mine told me about
how much time it would take to enter employees hours into 
Quick Books. Fed Clock automates the time consuming part 
of that process saving the records center time and money.

Fed clock takes into account rules specific to my
workplace regarding lunch breaks and excess time worked
that totals less than a tenth of an hour. If you want to 
use this for your workplace, you may need to tweak the 
code to fit your needs.
